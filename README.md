# Ring_fencing_healthcare

## Instructions to run the code
We advise that the code be run on google colab in order to avoid dependency issues
## Steps to run the code
1. Upload "Ring_fencing_healthcare.ipynb" to google colab.
2. Upload the "Ring_fencing_files" folder to the google drive which will be mounted to the colab notebook
3. Upload "predictionmodel.py" to the runtime environment of "Ring_fencing_healthcare.ipynb" on google colab
4. Simple run all the cells in "Ring_fencing_healthcare.ipynb"

A query has already been run and outputs have been stored in the "Ring_fencing_healthcare.ipynb"

## Running in the local environment
Running the code on a local environment may cause depedency issues. We have already install the required libraries in the first cell of "Ring_fencing_healthcare.ipynb". This can be used to build a local environment to run the code. The "Ring_fencing_healthcare.ipynb" file can be run directly on a local environment after changing the paths for reading the three csv files - "healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv", "Final_query_dataset - Sheet1.csv", "Analysis_Classification_dataset - Sheet1.csv" and the "stroke.txt" file. The "predictionmodel.py" should also be placed in the same folder as "Ring_fencing_healthcare.ipynb".

We have provided python notebooks with saved outputs that show the results attached in our paper. These results may also be reproduced through these python notebooks. We have also provided the corresponding ".py" files for each notebook.
